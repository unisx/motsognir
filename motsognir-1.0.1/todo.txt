TODO ideas
 - configurable limitation on global number and per-ip number of processes
 - make it possible to use active content (cgi/php) as a default gophermap
 - when percent decoding fails, abort the request
 - detect (and log) when an active app (CGI/PHP) fails to be ran
 - Add option bindaddr and write documentation about how to create several gophers on a single server.
