* History of changes for the Motsognir gopher server *

v1.0.6 [11 Nov 2014]
 - Support for custom file mapping (extension to gopher filetype),
 - Serving gopher content from users directories, using the '/~username/' URL scheme (configurable),
 - Motsognir simulates a 'not found' message whenever a client tries to explicitely fetch a gophermap file,
 - Added support for sub-gophermap scripts,
 - Default location for the configuration file can be #defined at compile time (-DCONFIGFILE=/etc/motsognir.conf),
 - Updated the FreeBSD port files, kindly contributed by kaltheat.

v1.0.5 [05 Oct 2014]
 - Sanitizing the environment before calling a CGI/PHP child (contributed by Matt Lewandowsky),
 - Fixed the $HOME, $USER and $USERNAME environment variable when dropping root privileges (contributed by Matt Lewandowsky),
 - Added support for setting a custom http error file (HttpErrFile),
 - When logging IP addresses, IPv4 addresses are logged as 'normal' (short) addresses instead of IPV6MAPPED addresses,
 - The 'GopherHostname' setting is not mandatory anymore. If missing, local server's IP will be used automatically,
 - Support for custom IP binding (allows to use multiple gopher instances on a single server).

v1.0.4 [15 Mar 2014]
 - Server-side params are passed to dynamic gophermaps (CGI, PHP) now,
 - Dynamic gophermaps (CGI, PHP) can be used as a global (server-wide) gophermap.

v1.0.3 [06 Oct 2013]
 - Fixed HTTP answers to be sent without resetting the connection afterwards,
 - Added an optimization that sends \r\n trailers within the same packet than the content line,
 - Fixed the detection of CGI scripts exit status,
 - Fixed fetching of the IP address of the client (was failing on IPv6 addresses),
 - Fixed a bug causing Motsognir to listen on IPv6 only on some systems (namely FreeBSD),
 - Added a few missing #includes to make Motsognir compile without complaining on FreeBSD,
 - Added a short (10s) timeout for request receiving duration.

v1.0.2 [30 Sep 2013]
 - A failure at percent decoding of the query is aborting any further processing,
 - Added error logs when active content (CGI or PHP) fails with a non-zero return code,
 - Using a much bigger disk read buffer when serving a binary file (1M instead of 1K),
 - Adapted the init.d script to be more generic (was only working on Debian, should be good on most Linux distros now).

v1.0.1 [28 Sep 2013]
 - Daemonizing in a slightly cleaner way (changing working dir to / and calling setsid()),
 - Fixed encoding of UTF-8 characters in URLs (some characters were becoming corrupted after the URL encoding),
 - Added a configuration option to make Motsognir drop root privileges and switch to another user,
 - Added chroot support,
 - Fixed detection of file's extensions on filenames with several dots.

v1.0 [24 Sep 2013]
 - The whole code base has been rewritten from FreeBASIC to ANSI C,
 - Moved to a standalone server architecture with its own listening service (instead of relying on an inetd-like superserver),
 - Dropped Windows support,
 - Removed the authentication feature,
 - Removed the 'gopherlinks files' feature,
 - Removed the 'descript.ion metadata' feature,
 - Moved default configuration from /etc/motsognir.cfg to /etc/motsognir.conf,
 - Added command line parameter --config to specify a configuration in a custom location,
 - Added a file listing directive to gophermaps, allowing to show a dynamic list of files from within a gophermap,
 - Added PHP support,
 - Added a 'default gophermap' feature allowing to customize the look of an entire server with a global gophermap.

v0.99.2 [06 Aug 2013]
 - Added support for recursive paths in gophermaps (like "../../directory/").

v0.99.1 [11 Sep 2010]
 - Added support for caps.txt data (see the configuration file for more infos).

v0.99 [08 Jul 2010]
 - Motsognir has been forked from the gopher module of the Grumpy server,
 - Added support for UTF-8 filenames,
 - Implemented percent-encoding compliancy for URLs passed to the server,
 - Added support for very big files, up to 8EiB (was: max 2 GiB),
 - Fixed a minor file-locking bug (gophermap handles weren't released properly),
 - Fixed directory entries sorting (gopherlinks weren't sorted correctly in the list),
 - Implemented a HTTP requests detector (responds to any HTTP request by a HTTP error code),
 - Added more logging verbosity.
