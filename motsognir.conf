## Server's hostname ##
# The hostname the gopher server is reachable at. This setting is
# mandatory, because the gopher protocol is heavily relying on
# self-pointing links.
GopherHostname=gopher.mydomain.net

## Gopher TCP port ##
# The TCP port on which the public Gopher server listens on.
# Usually, gopher servers are published on port 70. Default: 70.
GopherPort=70

## Root directory ##
# That's the local path to Gopher resources.
# The default path is /var/gopher/
GopherRoot=/var/gopher/

## Activate the verbose mode ##
# Here you can enable/disable the verbose mode. In verbose mode,
# Motsognir will generate much more logs. This is useful only in
# debug situations.
# Possible values: 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled). Disabled by default.
Verbose=1

## CGI support ##
# The line below enables/disables CGI support. Read the manual
# for details.
# Possible values: 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled). Disabled by default.
GopherCgiSupport=0

## PHP support ##
# There you can enable PHP support.
# Possible values: 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled). Disabled by default.
GopherPhpSupport=0

## Default gophermap #
# If you wish that your server would use a default gophermap when displaying
# a directory that do not have a gophermap, you can specify here a path to
# the gophermap file you'd like to use.
DefaultGophermap=

## Caps.txt support ##
# Caps.txt is a specific file-like selector, which allows a gopher client to
# know more about the server's implementation (for example what the path's
# delimiter is, where is the server located, etc). When enabled, Motsognir
# will answer with caps-compatible data to requests for "/caps.txt".
# Caps support is enabled by default (CapsSupport=1).
CapsSupport=1

## Caps additionnal informations ##
# If Caps support is enabled, you can specify there some additional
# informations about your server. These informations will be served
# to gopher clients along with the CAPS.TXT data.
# Example:
#  CapsServerArchitecture=Linux/i386
#  CapsServerDescription=This is my server
#  CapsServerGeolocationString=Dobrogoszcz, Poland
CapsServerArchitecture=
CapsServerDescription=
CapsServerGeolocationString=
