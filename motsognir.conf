## Server's hostname ##
# The hostname the gopher server is reachable at. This setting is highly
# recommended, because the gopher protocol is heavily relying on
# self-pointing links. If not declared, the server's IP address will be used
# instead.
#GopherHostname=gopher.example.com

## Gopher TCP port ##
# The TCP port on which the public Gopher server listens on.
# Usually, gopher servers are published on port 70. Default: 70.
GopherPort=70

## Bind on IP address ##
# Set this 'bind' parameter to the IP address you'd like Motsognir to listen
# on. Note, that this parameter must be either an IPv6 address, or an IPv4
# address written in IPv4-mapped IPv6 notation (for ex. "::FFFF:10.0.0.1").
# If not specified, Motsognir will listen on all available IP addresses.
# This setting might be useful if you have a multihomed server, and you would
# like to serve different content for each IP address.
# Examples:
#  bind=2001:DB8:135:A0E3::2
#  bind=::FFFF:192.168.0.3
bind=

## Root directory ##
# That's the local path to Gopher resources. Note, that if you use
# a chroot configuration, you must provide here the virtual path
# instead of the real one.
# The default path is /var/gopher/
GopherRoot=/var/gopher/

## chroot configuration ##
# If you'd like to put Motsognir inside a chroot jail, configure here
# the chroot directory that shall be used.
# By default no chroot is used.
chroot=

## Activate the verbose mode ##
# Here you can enable/disable the verbose mode. In verbose mode,
# Motsognir will generate much more logs. This is useful only in
# debug situations.
# Possible values: 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled). Disabled by default.
Verbose=0

## CGI support ##
# The line below enables/disables CGI support. Read the manual
# for details.
# Possible values: 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled). Disabled by default.
GopherCgiSupport=0

## PHP support ##
# There you can enable PHP support.
# Possible values: 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled). Disabled by default.
GopherPhpSupport=0

## Run as another user ##
# If you start motsognir under a root account, you might want to configure
# it so it drops root privileges as soon as it doesn't need them anymore and
# switches to another user. This is recommended for increased security,
# unless you already run Motsognir as a non-root user.
# To do so, provide here the username of the user that Motsognir should run
# as. Default = no value.
RunAsUser=

## Default gophermap #
# If you wish that your server would use a default gophermap when displaying
# a directory that do not have a gophermap, you can specify here a path to
# the gophermap file you'd like to use.
DefaultGophermap=

## HTTP error file
# When Motsognir receives a HTTP request, it answers with a HTTP error,
# along with a html message indicating why it is wrong. If you'd like to use
# a custom html file, you can set it here. Note, that the specified file is
# loaded when Motsognir's starts. If you modify the file afterwards, you'll
# need to restart the Motsognir process for the file to be reloaded.
# Example: HttpErrFile=/etc/motsognir-httperr.html
HttpErrFile=

## Caps.txt support ##
# Caps.txt is a specific file-like selector, which allows a gopher client to
# know more about the server's implementation (for example what the path's
# delimiter is, where is the server located, etc). When enabled, Motsognir
# will answer with caps-compatible data to requests for "/caps.txt".
# Caps support is enabled by default (CapsSupport=1).
CapsSupport=1

## Caps additionnal informations ##
# If Caps support is enabled, you can specify there some additional
# informations about your server. These informations will be served
# to gopher clients along with the CAPS.TXT data.
# Example:
#  CapsServerArchitecture=Linux/i386
#  CapsServerDescription=This is my server
#  CapsServerGeolocationString=Dobrogoszcz, Poland
CapsServerArchitecture=
CapsServerDescription=
CapsServerGeolocationString=

# [End of file here]
