* History of changes for the Motsognir gopher server *

v1.0.2 [30 Sep 2013]
 - A failure at percent decoding of the query is aborting any further processing,
 - Added error logs when active content (CGI or PHP) fails with a non-zero return code,
 - Using a much bigger disk read buffer when serving a binary file (1M instead of 1K),
 - Adapted the init.d script to be more generic (was only working on Debian, should be good on most Linux distros now).

v1.0.1 [28 Sep 2013]
 - Daemonizing in a slightly cleaner way (changing working dir to / and calling setsid()),
 - Fixed encoding of UTF-8 characters in URLs (some characters were becoming corrupted after the URL encoding),
 - Added a configuration option to make Motsognir drop root privileges and switch to another user,
 - Added chroot support,
 - Fixed detection of file's extensions on filenames with several dots.

v1.0 [24 Sep 2013]
 - The whole code base has been rewritten from FreeBASIC to ANSI C,
 - Moved to a standalone server architecture with its own listening service (instead of relying on an inetd-like superserver),
 - Dropped Windows support,
 - Removed the authentication feature,
 - Removed the 'gopherlinks files' feature,
 - Removed the 'descript.ion metadata' feature,
 - Moved default configuration from /etc/motsognir.cfg to /etc/motsognir.conf,
 - Added command line parameter --config to specify a configuration in a custom location,
 - Added a file listing directive to gophermaps, allowing to show a dynamic list of files from within a gophermap,
 - Added PHP support,
 - Added a 'default gophermap' feature allowing to customize the look of an entire server with a global gophermap.

v0.99.2 [06 Aug 2013]
 - Added support for recursive paths in gophermaps (like "../../directory/").

v0.99.1 [11 Sep 2010]
 - Added support for caps.txt data (see the configuration file for more infos).

v0.99 [08 Jul 2010]
 - Motsognir has been forked from the gopher module of the Grumpy server,
 - Added support for UTF-8 filenames,
 - Implemented percent-encoding compliancy for URLs passed to the server,
 - Added support for very big files, up to 8EiB (was: max 2 GiB),
 - Fixed a minor file-locking bug (gophermap handles weren't released properly),
 - Fixed directory entries sorting (gopherlinks weren't sorted correctly in the list),
 - Implemented a HTTP requests detector (responds to any HTTP request by a HTTP error code),
 - Added more logging verbosity.
